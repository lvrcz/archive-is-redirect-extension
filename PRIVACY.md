### **Privacy Policy**

**"Open in archive.is" does not collect, store, or share any of your personal data.**

#### How It Works

*   The extension takes the URL of the link you right-click and opens it on `archive.is`.
*   This URL is sent directly to the `archive.is` service in your browser. It is **never** sent to the developer of this extension or any other third party.
*   A script then runs **only on the `archive.is` page** to redirect you to the newest snapshot.

#### Permissions Used

*   **`contextMenus`**: Needed to add the "Open link in archive.is (Newest)" option to your right-click menu.
*   **Host Permissions (`archive.is`, etc.)**: Needed to run the automatic redirect script on the archive pages. The script does nothing else.

This extension has no servers and does not track you. If you have questions, please open an issue on the GitHub repository.
